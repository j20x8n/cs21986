Linguistics   101 (850):   Introduction to   Linguistic Analysis
Syllabus, Winter 2024
Course   Description and   Objectives
This course   presents an   introduction to the core areas of   linguistics   and   a   discussion   of the   fundamental concepts in the study of language. We will   explore   technical   aspects   of   linguistic   theory   as well as broader questions about language   as   a   specifically   human   phenomenon. We will   examine   in depth the subfields of phonetics,   phonology,   morphology, syntax, and   semantics.
At the completion of this course, you may expect   (1)   to   understand   the   principles   of the   structural   system underlying all   human languages, (2) to   have   some   facility   in   the   technical   analysis   and   description of language samples, and (3) to appreciate   the   intricacy   and   elegance   of our   human   communication system.

Quizzes
Quizzes are accessed through eClass.   For each   module, there   is a self-test   quiz   which   does   not   count   towards your final grade   but should give you an   idea   how you will   be tested   on the   module,   and   there is an official quiz which does count toward your final   grade.   This   official quiz   will be   available   from   midnight at the start of   the day to midnight at the end of   that day (24   hours). You   may   begin each quiz at any time during the   period   it   is open. You   must   finish   with代 写Linguistics 101 (850): Introduction to Linguistic Analysis Winter 2024Java
代做程序编程语言in   60   minutes,   and   by   the   time   it   closes (whichever comes first). You   may use notes   and   your textbook   as   you wish.
Although   it   is   possible to do the quizzes on a   mobile device,   some   questions   come   out   mis-formatted   on small screens and so   using a smart   phone   or tablet   may   result   in   poorer grades.   You   are   responsible for using a device with sufficient screen space.   (You   may   try   the   self-test   practice   quizzes   to help determine whether the device you wish to   use   is sufficient.)
All standards of academic integrity remain   in force for   quizzes.
